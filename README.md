# vowpal wabbit


## Installation


If you hit this error:
```
       Could NOT find Boost (missing: Boost_INCLUDE_DIR)
      Call Stack (most recent call first):
```

Install this:
```bash
$ brew install boost-python3
```

Then reinstall vowpalwabbit:
```bash
$ pip install vowpalwabbit
```

Seems like vowpalwabbit is not compatible with python 3.11 yet:

```bash
$ poetry env use 3.10
```
